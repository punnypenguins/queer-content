> "Do Not Lie Down. Do Not Roll Over." is a solo journaling game about how treacherous it is to be a trans person interacting with cis people on the daily, about how easily trust and comfort becomes betrayal when you are transgender, about how casually you will be disrespected.  It is also a game about the inherent frustration that comes from experiencing this.
