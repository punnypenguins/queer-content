[& WITH MY ANGER I WILL GROW](https://kaymarlow.itch.io/and-with-my-anger-i-will-grow)

> & WITH MY ANGER I WILL GROW is a one-page, single-player game that you can play during your everyday life. It's a reminder that you are allowed to feel your feelings and that anger is a powerful tool. When so much bad stuff is happening around us, it's important for us to still be there for ourselves.

> "Do Not Lie Down. Do Not Roll Over." is a solo journaling game about how treacherous it is to be a trans person interacting with cis people on the daily, about how easily trust and comfort becomes betrayal when you are transgender, about how casually you will be disrespected.  It is also a game about the inherent frustration that comes from experiencing this.
