[Cast A Queer Spell](https://silentferrets.itch.io/cast-a-queer-spell)

> Cast A Queer Spell is a journaling game about growing up weird in a wizard community that believes everyone is normal. Be born, get sorted using "completely accurate" manatyping, learn magic, cast spells, grow up, face the consequences. Wizards don't know everything.

> "Do Not Lie Down. Do Not Roll Over." is a solo journaling game about how treacherous it is to be a trans person interacting with cis people on the daily, about how easily trust and comfort becomes betrayal when you are transgender, about how casually you will be disrespected.  It is also a game about the inherent frustration that comes from experiencing this.
